# The Media Trust Real-Time Ad Defense

## Overview

 As malvertising, scams, and controversial and offensive ad content proliferate across the digital media ecosystem, publishers need advanced controls to both shield audiences from malware attacks and ensure quality site experience. With the marketâ€™s fastest and most comprehensive real-time ad quality tool, The Media Trust empowers publisher Ad/Revenue Operations teams to block a wide range of malware, high-risk ad platforms, heavy ads, ads with sensitive or objectionable content, and custom lists (e.g., competitors). Customizable replacement code calls for a new ad to ensure impressions are still monetized.
